"""Utility helpers for the Streamlit app and CLI tools."""

# This module previously contained helpers for working with Google URLs and
# persisting history to ``.tak_history.json``. Those functions were removed to
# simplify the application. The file remains so existing imports do not fail,
# but no public helpers are currently defined.
